<div> <p>Dolphins will not swim with or "kiss," people, or tow them through the water. <b>Sunshine</b>  They do it because they must. Because they are not natural behaviors, all dolphins in captivity have been trained to correct these behaviors.</p><p>1. Killer whale (Orcinus Orca). We think of orcas as living in colder climates. <b>Kayaking</b>  <i>Sea</i>  But, approximately 500 orcas can be found in the Gulf of Mexico. They eat tuna, dolphins, and other marine life in the Gulf's deep water, which is often far away from land.</p><p>Tail slapping, which dolphins do to stun fish by slapping their tails against water's surface, is quite obvious. Kerplunking is an interesting behaviour, named after the sound it makes.</p> <b>Climate</b></div>

We can quickly get you on the water wearing your snorkel gear without the disruptions and splashing that large groups cause. This is often what scares the dolphins away.
